# ScrapMechanicSeedTool

This tool was designed for scrap mechanic v0.4.0
So that we could easily share good map seeds by allowing others to view/modify map seeds.
**This is untested with creative saves, tool was created for survival saves**

### GUI
The seed tool has a graphical user interface, so that people without any programming knowledge can easily modify save seed's!

### Options

**Current Seed**
This is the seed that will be used for all other options

**Seed to use / Set seed**
This is where you can change the current seed manually

**Extract seed from save file**
This option will prompt you to choose a save file so that it can set the current seed to the seed of the map

**Inject seed into save file**
This option allows you to modify the seed of a save file. I added this features since dev tools give you the /recreate command which resets the world. I believe the seed is still being used for that command, I will attempt to try a bunch of different ideas.

**Modify world gen seed to be constant**
This options sets the seed of ALL newly generated worlds to the Current Seed.

**Reset world gen to default**
This option will reverse the effects of modifying the world gen seed, so that it will no longer be constant.


##### Hope you all enjoy this very small tool
